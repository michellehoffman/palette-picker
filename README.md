### Palette Picker
Module 4 project | Turing School of Software & Design

---

#### Summary
Palette Picker is a palette generator designed to mimic the functionality of the [Coolors](https://coolors.co/000000-291528-3a3e3b-f0eff4-9e829c) application. Users are able to create projects, generate a random color palette, lock certain colors so they don't change, and save their finished palette to a project in the database. They can also delete color palettes when they are done.
